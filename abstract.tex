  Science requires data. Some work exists toward producing synthetic data sets
  for testing information systems in a controlled way, but never addresses
  whether these are representative of the real world. To produce data sets that
  can plausibly be described as ``realistic'', we note that it is necessary to
  account for unexpected behaviors which would produce noise in deployed
  business processes. We present a novel approach to simulation, where variance
  in behavior is captured as a component of a model, and used to introduce
  errors in the behavior represented by such a model. These possibly erroneous
  behaviors are simulated, introducing realistic noise to generated data sets.
  Implementation of models under this new paradigm is detailed. The new paradigm
  introduced lends a new perspective on modeling with impacts on the broader
  BPMDS community. % I've removed ``And these impacts are discussed''.
